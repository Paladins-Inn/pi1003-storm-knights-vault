## Abstract

A small vault for transfering content from one world of a single Foundry VTT instance to another world on the same instance.
You just install the module.
Then you need to unlock the compendia to make them usable.
Just drag and drop the content in the appropriate compendium.
Then switch worlds and the content should be there.

The content will not be synched automatically if you change the stuff in one world.
You will need to copy it yourself.

## Installation

Just enter the manifest URL into the installation requestor for Foundry VTT modules.
The URL is [https://www.paladins-inn.de/fvtt/pi1003/v11/module.json](https://www.paladins-inn.de/fvtt/pi1003/v11/module.json)
